/*
 * ðŸ’¡ Java Arrays Are Objects
In Java, everything except primitive types (int, char, etc.) is an object.

When you write this:

int[] arr;
Youâ€™re declaring a reference variable named arr that can point to an object of type int array. But right now, it points to nothing (i.e., it's null).

Then you write:

arr = new int[5];
Now this does 2 things:

Allocates memory for 5 integers (all set to 0 by default).

Creates an object in heap memory â€” like:
new int[]{0, 0, 0, 0, 0}

Sets arr to refer to that object.

âœ… So now arr points to a real array object in memory.
